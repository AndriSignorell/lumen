#' Shapiro-Francia test for normality
#' 
#' A goodness-of-fit test for normality based on the correlation between 
#' the ordered sample values and the corresponding expected normal order 
#' statistics, particularly suited for larger sample sizes than the 
#' Shapiro-Wilk test.
#' 
#' Performs the Shapiro-Francia test for the composite hypothesis of normality,
#' see e.g. Thode (2002, Sec. 2.3.2).
#' 
#' The test statistic of the Shapiro-Francia test is simply the squared
#' correlation between the ordered sample values and the (approximated)
#' expected ordered quantiles from the standard normal distribution. The
#' p-value is computed from the formula given by Royston (1993).
#' 
#' @param x a numeric vector of data values, the number of which must be
#' between 5 and 5000. Missing values are allowed.
#' 
#' @return A list with class \dQuote{htest} containing the following
#' components: \item{statistic}{the value of the Shapiro-Francia statistic.}
#' \item{p.value }{the p-value for the test.} \item{method}{the character
#' string \dQuote{Shapiro-Francia normality test}.} \item{data.name}{a
#' character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
#' @note The Shapiro-Francia test is known to perform well, see also the
#' comments by Royston (1993). The expected ordered quantiles from the standard
#' normal distribution are approximated by \code{qnorm(ppoints(x, a = 3/8))},
#' being slightly different from the approximation \code{qnorm(ppoints(x, a =
#' 1/2))} used for the normal quantile-quantile plot by \code{\link{qqnorm}}
#' for sample sizes greater than 10.

#' Based on code by Juergen Gross.
