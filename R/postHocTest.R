#' Post-Hoc Tests
#' 
#' A wrapper function providing a unified interface to various parametric 
#' and nonparametric post hoc tests for multiple pairwise comparisons 
#' following a significant omnibus test.
#' 
#' A convenience wrapper for computing post-hoc test after having calculated an
#' ANOVA. 
#' 
#' The function is designed to consolidate a couple of post-hoc tests with the
#' same interface for input and output.
#' 
#' \bold{Choosing Tests.} \verb{ } Different post hoc tests use different
#' methods to control familywise (FW) and per experiment error rate (PE). Some
#' tests are very conservative. Conservative tests go to great lengths to
#' prevent the user from committing a type 1 error.  They use more stringent
#' criterion for determining significance. Many of these tests become more and
#' more stringent as the number of groups increases (directly limiting the FW
#' and PE error rate). Although these tests buy you protection against type 1
#' error, it comes at a cost. As the tests become more stringent, you loose
#' power (1-B).  More liberal tests, buy you power but the cost is an increased
#' chance of type 1 error.  There is no set rule for determining which test to
#' use, but different researchers have offered some guidelines for choosing.
#' Mostly it is an issue of pragmatics and whether the number of comparisons
#' exceeds k-1.
#' 
#' \bold{The Fisher's LSD} \verb{ } (Least Significant Different) sets alpha
#' level per comparison. alpha = .05 for every comparison. df = df error (i.e.
#' df within). This test is the most liberal of all post hoc tests. The
#' critical t for significance is unaffected by the number of groups. This test
#' is appropriate when you have 3 means to compare. In general the alpha is
#' held at .05 because of the criterion that you can't look at LSD's unless the
#' ANOVA is significant. This test is generally not considered appropriate if
#' you have more than 3 means unless there is reason to believe that there is
#' no more than one true null hypothesis hidden in the means.
#' 
#' \bold{Dunn's (Bonferroni) t-test} \verb{ } is sometimes referred to as the
#' Bonferroni t because it used the Bonferroni PE correction procedure in
#' determining the critical value for significance. In general, this test
#' should be used when the number of comparisons you are making exceeds the
#' number of degrees of freedom you have between groups (e.g. k-1). This test
#' sets alpha per experiment; alpha = (.05)/c for every comparison. df = df
#' error (c = number of comparisons (k(k-1))/2) This test is extremely
#' conservative and rapidly reduces power as the number of comparisons being
#' made increase.
#' 
#' \bold{Newman-Keuls} \verb{ } is a step down procedure that is not as
#' conservative as Dunn's t test. First, the means of the groups are ordered
#' (ascending or descending) and then the largest and smallest means are tested
#' for significant differences. If those means are different, then test
#' smallest with next largest, until you reach a test that is not significant.
#' Once you reach that point then you can only test differences between means
#' that exceed the difference between the means that were found to be
#' non-significant. Newman-Keuls is perhaps one of the most common post hoc
#' test, but it is a rather controversial test. The major problem with this
#' test is that when there is more than one true null hypothesis in a set of
#' means it will overestimate the FW error rate. In general we would use this
#' when the number of comparisons we are making is larger than k-1 and we don't
#' want to be as conservative as the Dunn's test is.
#' 
#' \bold{Tukey's HSD} \verb{ } (Honestly Significant Difference) is essentially
#' like the Newman-Keuls, but the tests between each mean are compared to the
#' critical value that is set for the test of the means that are furthest apart
#' (rmax e.g. if there are 5 means we use the critical value determined for the
#' test of X1 and X5). This method corrects for the problem found in the
#' Newman-Keuls where the FW is inflated when there is more than one true null
#' hypothesis in a set of means. It buys protection against type 1 error, but
#' again at the cost of power. It tends to be the most common and preferred
#' test because it is very conservative with respect to type 1 error when the
#' null hypothesis is true. In general, HSD is preferred when you will make all
#' the possible comparisons between a large set of means (6 or more means).
#' 
#' \bold{The Scheffe test} \verb{ } is designed to protect against a type 1
#' error when all possible complex and simple comparisons are made. That is we
#' are not just looking the possible combinations of comparisons between pairs
#' of means. We are also looking at the possible combinations of comparisons
#' between groups of means. Thus Scheffe is the most conservative of all tests.
#' Because this test does give us the capacity to look at complex comparisons,
#' it essentially uses the same statistic as the linear contrasts tests.
#' However, Scheffe uses a different critical value (or at least it makes an
#' adjustment to the critical value of F). This test has less power than the
#' HSD when you are making pairwise (simple) comparisons, but it has more power
#' than HSD when you are making complex comparisons. In general, only use this
#' when you want to make many post hoc complex comparisons (e.g. more than
#' k-1).
#' 
#' \bold{Tables} \verb{ } For tables pairwise chi-square test can be performed,
#' either without correction or with correction for multiple testing following
#' the logic in \code{\link{p.adjust}}.

#' @name postHoc
#' @aliases postHocTest postHocTest.aov postHocTest.table postHocTest.matrix

#' @param x an aov object. 
#' @param method one of \code{"hsd"}, \code{"bonf"}, \code{"lsd"},
#' \code{"scheffe"}, \code{"newmankeuls"}, defining the method for the pairwise
#' comparisons.\cr For the post hoc test of tables the methods of
#' \code{\link{p.adjust}} can be supplied. See the detail there. 
#' @param which a character vector listing terms in the fitted model for which
#' the intervals should be calculated. Defaults to all the terms. 
#' @param conf.level a numeric value between zero and one giving the
#' family-wise confidence level to use.  If this is set to NA, just a matrix
#' with the p-values will be returned. 
#' @param ordered a logical value indicating if the levels of the factor should
#' be ordered according to increasing average in the sample before taking
#' differences. If ordered is \code{TRUE} then the calculated differences in
#' the means will all be positive. The significant differences will be those
#' for which the lower end point is positive. \cr This argument will be ignored
#' if method is not either \code{hsd} or \code{newmankeuls}.
#' @param digits controls the number of fixed digits to print.
#' @param \dots further arguments, not used so far.
#'  
#' @return an object of type "postHocTest", which will either be \cr A) a list
#' of data.frames containing the mean difference, lower ci, upper ci and the
#' p-value, if a conf.level was defined (something else than NA) or \cr B) a
#' list of matrices with the p-values, if conf.level has been set to NA.
